            <p>My hobbie is soccer.Soccer gets me energized and helps my feet's muscles.I like to play soccer with my family, my cousins, and with my classmates.I like playing soccer because I learn a new skill everyday.Also did you know that almost all the countries in the world play soccer?Soccer makes me comfortable and energized.Soccer is a sport that you use with your legs bout goalies (the ones in front of the goal) can catch the ball with their hands, they can kick the ball or throw it.Their should be only 11 players in a soccer ball game.The best countrie of playing soccer is Brazil.</p>
